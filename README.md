# Food-Selector-Optimization-Algorithm
Repo of codes that applies Greedy and Brute Force Algorithm to optimize the food menu based on max allowable calories 
This code is developed based using the course material offered by MIT for the "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science" 

User Instruction: The Driver Code file is "FoodSelector.py". user can enter the max allowable calories to get the list of suggested foods with food values and calories OR the user can type "exit" to terminate the program
